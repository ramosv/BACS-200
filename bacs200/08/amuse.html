    <h1>Amusements</h1>

    <h2>My Amusement #1 is FIFA</h2>
    <p>FIFA stand for the Fédération Internationale de Football Association. It is a non-profit organization and they describe themselves as a international governin body of association football,fútsal, beach soccer, and efootball. It is the highest governing body of football. </p>
    <p>Basically every continent in the word has a branch of FIFA. These branches are know as confederations. FIFA's six confederations represent different regions of the world: UEFA (Europe), CAF (Africa), CONCACAF (North and Central America), CONMEBOL (South America), OFC (New Zealand and South Pacific island nations) and AFC (Asia) </p>

    <h2>My Amusement #2 is Netflix</h2>
    <p>Let's be honest, who doesn't love Netflix. I try not to binge too many shows at once because then I find myself with little to no time to do my school work. I am from the genreation that had to make the trip to BlockBuster to watch movies or try out a Playstation 2 game before buying the game.</p>
    <p>There are many other streaming services that are just as good as Netflix, but I decided to pick Netflix above others because they are kind of the pioners when it comes to streaming. So in a way thanks to them we now have all these cool options for streaming our favorite shows and movies</p>

    <h2>My Amusement #3 is Akinator </h2>
    <p>Akinator is a computer game and also a mobile application that reads your mind. Akinator is basically a virtual genie that tries to guess what fictional or real-life character the player is think of. This was initally relased in 2007 by a French company called Elokence</p>
    <p>The best way to understand the game and how it works is by actually playing it in my opinion. Go ahead and give it a try, Akinator most likely will know which character you are thinking about. Kind of creepy but also fun</p>
