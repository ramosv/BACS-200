        This last century we have seen so many influential individuals that it can be difficult to find the one that sits at the top of your list.
        It took me some time to find my absolute favorite individual but I finally decided to choose Mahatma Ghandi.

    </p>
    <p>
        The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Zero to No Fear - It is natural for humans to feel fear but some special individuals use this fear as fuel to reach their goals</li>
        <li>Positively influence others - Helped changed the mentality of a lot of people</li>
        <li>Awareness - educate people on things that are important others</li>
        <li>Sacrifice & commitment - their impact usually costs them everything</li>
        <li>Positivity - After facing numerous adversities, they still continue with a very positive attitude</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Mahatma Ghandi achieved what no other man of his era was able to. It eventually made people so mad that his movement of peace was growing at a globally that he was assinated. I hope to one day achieve a small percantage of what this man was able to achieve in his life time. More information about Mahatma Ghandi attached to this page.
