            This last century we have seen so many influential individuals that it can be difficult to find the one that sits at the top of your list.
            It took me some time to find my absulute favorite individual but I finally decided to choose Mahatma Ghandi.

            The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Outrageously courageous - they disturb the status quo and define a new normal</li>
            <li>Motivate others - people follow a great leader</li>
            <li>Big footprint - impact on millions and change the world</li>
            <li>Sacrifice & commitment - their impact usually costs them everything</li>
            <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Over the last 100 years no man exemplifies these values for me more than
            Martin Luther King.  He called people to be accountable for the racial
            prejudices that we all carry.   He demonstrated that violence is not the
            best way to create lasting change. And throughout his life he sacrificed
            everything to make the world better.
